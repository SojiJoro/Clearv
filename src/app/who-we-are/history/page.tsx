          A legacy of care, a future of compassion.

          Clear Vital Social Care was founded with one simple vision: **to make quality care accessible 
          to those who need it the most**. Since our establishment, we have grown into a trusted provider 
          of social care services across the UK, supporting adults, children, and families through 
          dedicated residential, community, and specialist services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey began with a small team of **passionate carers and social workers** who recognised the 
          need for a **holistic, person-first approach** to care. Over the years, we have expanded our reach, 
          developing innovative programs to support people with **learning disabilities, autism, dementia, 
          and complex care needs**.
        </p>
        <p className="fw-bold">
          Today, we continue to evolve, but our values remain the same: **compassion, inclusivity, and excellence**.
